## Hardware
- 2 3x3 tiles for difficult terrain
- 1 1x4 tile for difficult terrain
- 1 home team of 5 D&D characters
- 1 away team of 5 D&D characters
- 1 10x10 grid

## Game board description

The game board is addressed with percentile dice.
The tens die is the north south coordinate.
The ones die is the east west coordinate.
Numbering starts in the lower left square.

## Game board setup

Before the game is started the difficult terrain tiles are placed.
All tiles are placed by rolling a d100.
The lower left corner of the tile is placed on the specific square rolled.
For the 1x4 tile, a d6 is rolled and the tile is placed with the longer dimension aligned north-south if the value is even, east-west if the value is odd.

## Batting order.

The batting order for the duration of the game is assigned by the team as they wish.
Once created, the batting order is fixed for the duration of the game.
2 players, one from each team, form a batting/pitching pair.
Thus the first positions from each team are paired up and bat and pitch together. The second position players pair up and so forth.
If one of the players becomes inactive, the player does not bat and another team member must pinch pitch for that player.
Pinch pitching does not affect the batting order.
If both players of the batting/pitching pair are inactive, that pair is skipped.
The away team always batts first in the pair order.

## Before the first pitch

Before pitching is started, starting with the second in the batting order, the players arrange themselves around the field.
Players alternate turns starting with the away team following the batting order and place themselves on the field except for the squares 75 (pitching mound) and 35 (batter's box).
The players first in the batting order are placed on the pitching mound and batterâ€™s box respective to their future rolls.

## Before each pitch

The current pitcher and batter are placed on the correct location prior to the pitch.  They may move from their locations once the balls are in play.

## Playing Wriggley ball

After the pitcher and batter players are moved from their current location on the field to the respective batting box (square 35) and pitching mound (square 75).  The pitching may begin.

### Rolling for a pitch
The pitcher rolls 2d6 while the batter rolls a 1d12.  If the pitcher rolls higher than the batter, the batter is out.  If the batter ties or rolls higher than the pitcher, the difference between the batter's roll and pitcher's roll places that many balls +1 into play.  For instance:

|Batter|Pitcher|Num of balls in play|
| --- | --- | --- |
|10|12|Batter is out|
|10|5|6 balls in play (5+1) |
|2|2|1 ball in play (0+1)|

## Placing balls in play
For each ball placed into play a d100 is rolled and the ball is placed on that square. 

If the ball lands on a square occupied by a pitching team player, the ball is immediately destroyed. (No action needed)

If the ball lands on a square occupied by a hitting team player, the automatically counts as a score. (No action needed)

After all the balls are placed into play or have been scored and destroyed, the players may move, act on the balls, or attack each other for one round of initiative.  

The ordering of action after the balls are hit is based on a fresh initiative roll by each of the active players.

## To act on a ball

If the player enters the square of a ball, the player may choose to use their action to either:
- If the player's team is currently hitting, remove the ball from play and count it as a score.
- If the player's team is currently pitching, remove the ball from play.  Denying the hitting team from the ability to score.

Destroying/Denying and scoring on a ball is an action.

## After one round of initiative.
After all players have completed one round of initiative, all remaining active balls expire and are removed from the field.
All players stay in their current locations except for the current batting pair.  
After the away team hits the home team becomes the batter and the opposing batter now becomes the pitcher.
If the home team has finished batting, then the next pair becomes the batter/pitcher pair.
After all remaining pairs have completed a round of batting, the next inning starts.
A total of three innings are allowed.

## Attacking opposing players
 
All moves and actions that are permitted in DnD 5e are permitted during play,  When a player hits zero hit points, they become inactive and are removed from the field of play.  An inactive player can not bat, and must be pinched pitched.  

## What stops the game

The game is played for 3 innings, or 3 cycles of completing all batting orders.  The game is also halted if all players of one team are eliminated.  The score at the time of the last player from a team becoming eliminated is the final score.

## Winning the game

The only way to win the game is to score more points then the other team.  Even if the one team has had all their players eliminated, they can still win by having more points when their team is eliminated.
