## Game board description

The game board is addressed with percentile dice.  The tens dice is the north south corrodinate.  The ones
dice is the east west corrodinate.  Numbering starts in the lower left square.

## Game board setup

Before the game is started the difficult terrain tiles are placed.  For the 3x3 tiles 
areaced by rolling the d100.  The lower left corner of the tile is placed on the specific square rolled.
For the 1x4 tile, a d6 is rolled and the tile is placed north-south if the value is even, east-west if the value is odd.
Like the 3x3 the lower left tile square is placed on the corridiate of the d100 roll.

## Batting order.

The batting order of each inning is assigned by the team as they wish.  This batting order is fixed for the durration 
of the game.

The away team aways batts first.

## Before the first pitch

Before pitching is started, the players must place themselves around the feild, alternating turns starting with the away team following the batting order.  Any place on the field may be selected except for the squares 75 (pitching mound) and 35 (batter's box).

---
## The first pitch

The first 2 players from each of the batting order team become the pair of battsman and pitcher.  The away team batts first.  Those players are moved from their location on the field to the respective batting box and pitching mound.

---
## Pitching
The pitcher rolls 2d6 while the batter rolls a 1d12.  If the pitcher rolls higher than the batter, the batter is out.  If the batter ties or rolls higher than the pitcher, the difference between the batter's roll and pitcher's roll places that many balls +1 into play.  For instance:

|Batter|Pitcher|Num of balls in play|
| --- | --- | --- |
|10|12|Batter is out|
|10|5|6 balls in play (5+1) |
|2|2|1 ball in play (0+1)|

## Placing balls in play
For each ball placed into play a d100 is rolled and the ball is placed on that square. 

If the ball lands on a square occupied by a pitching team player, the ball is imidiately destroyed. 

If the ball lands on a square occupied by a hitting team player, the automatically counts as a score.

After all the balls are placed into play, the players try and act on the balls or attack each other for one round.

Acting on a ball the by a hitting player they need to enter that square by using their movement without dashing.  It takes a full action to score or destory a ball.  If the hitting teams player enters a balls square it may perform a score.  If the pitching team's player enters the ball's square, the ball may be destroyed.  Destorying and scoring with a ball is a full action.

Once all active players have completed thier turn, starting with the batter, alternating between teams.  When the action returns to the batter the balls deactivate.  Then the pitcher becomes the batter and the pitcher the batter.

The round follows batting order of both teams wrapping around after the 5th in the batting order.

Attacking opposing players
---- 

All moves and actions are permitted during play,  When a player hits zero hit points, they become inactive and are removed from the field of play.
